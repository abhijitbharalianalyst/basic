Usage Rate is a concept borrowed from basketball analysis. According to Martin Hawkes-Teeter (who is also the inspiration for this analysis), Usage Rate is an attempt to measure the influence each player has in a team's attack by looking at the percentage of a team's possessions he "uses", or has the final action of a possession, weighted by minutes played.
I have collected data from the last 3 seasons of the Indian Super League (the 10-team seasons) and have put Hawkes-Teeter's concept of Usage Rate into practice, with a few tweaks.
A possessions framework is used, which is different from larger accumulations of individual counting stats like per-game or per-90s. Each possession can have a series of events like a successful pass, a successful dribble, a cross, an assist and a shot. Another example can be a successful pass, a successful pass, an unsuccessful pass. 
Only shots which are not direct free kicks or penalties are considered, while possessions are considered to end upon the following events happening:
1) Shot
2) Inaccurate pass
3) Unsuccessful take-on
5) Dispossessed
4) Foul by opposition
5) Offside
